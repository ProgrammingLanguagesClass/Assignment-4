# Assignment 4
Solve problems 1-5 by editing the part marked by `// Write your code here` in the **main.cpp** file of each folder.
DO NOT edit any other code or files. DO NOT rename, add, remove, or move any file or folder.
**Any change you make to other files may cause your submission to fail.**

and assign your output to the return variable.
