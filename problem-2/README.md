## Problem 2
Write code to multiply an array `x` by a matrix `y`.
Array `x` has size of `1xn`, while matrix `y` has size of `nxn`,
so the result is a `1xn` array.

Your function should call another function `multiply ()` that multiplies two arrays and return a value
(e.g. copy function from problem 3 of assignment 3).

**Hint**: You will also need to call your `transpose( )` function from [problem 1](../problem-1) to transpose the `y` matrix for correct result.
Remember to include `../problem-1/main.h` for that.

Edit the `multiply( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes `x`, `y`, and `n` as input and returns the `result` array as the output.

>*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
