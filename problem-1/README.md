## Problem 1
Write code to transpose an `nxn` matrix.

Edit the `transpose( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes matrix `x` and size `n` as inputs and returns the `result` matrix as the output.

>*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
