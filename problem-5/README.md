## Problem 5
Write code to calculate the factorial of `n` **recursively**.

Remember that: `n! = n * (n-1)!` and `0! = 1`

Edit the `factorial( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes `n` and returns the factorial as the output.


>*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
