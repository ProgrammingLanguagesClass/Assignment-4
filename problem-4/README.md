## Problem 4
Repeat [problem 3](../problem-3) without calling another function,
i.e. Use only loops to perform the multiplication of the two matrices.
*Which way is easier to implement?*

Edit the `multiplyMatrices( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes matrices `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` as input and returns the `result` matrix as the output.

>*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
