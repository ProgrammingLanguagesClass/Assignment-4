## Problem 3
Write code to multiply two matrices x and y.
Matrix `x` has size of `nxm`, and matrix `y` has size of `mxn`,
so the result should be an `nxn` matrix.
Your solution should call the `multiply( )` function from [problem 2](../problem-2) to multiply each row of `x` by `y`.

*Hint*: Remember to include ../problem-2/main.h

Edit the `multiply( )` function in the **main.cpp** file.
The function takes `x`, `y`, `n`, and `m` as input and returns the `result` matrix as the output.

>*Do not write a main function*.
Only edit the part marked with `// Write your code here`
